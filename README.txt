🎉🔥Get warm and have fun with our updated app, "Mill Heating"! Thanks to the brilliant work by Glenn S. Pedersen 👏💻, we've forged this app to work with Homey apps SDK 3 and support for the new and improved Homey Pro 2023.🚀🏠

We're diving deep into the warmth sphere and support all your Mill WiFi heaters, in theory though 😉💨🔥. Our fantastic, warmth-loving community have tested and confirmed the following models work perfectly:

AV600WIFI 🌡️
AV800LWIFI 🌡️
AV1000LWIFI 🌡️
AV1200WIFI 🌡️
NE600WIFI 🌡️
NE1200WIFI 🌡️
We're giving you all the thermostat control you've ever dreamed of, and a bit more! 🎛️⏱️😎

What can you trigger? 🎯

What actions can you take? 🦸‍♂️

Set thermostat mode
To use the app 📱, open Settings and enter your Mill credentials before attempting to add any heaters. Then enter the heater device settings to set the power usage.

Mill service comes with three comfy modes: Comfort 😌, Sleep 🌙, and Away 🏖️.

Upon mode change, the temperature will adjust to the set temperature of that mode. Adjusting the temperature changes the set point for that mode.

If you select the mode "Program", Mill service will take control and adjust the mode throughout the day according to the program you set up in the Mill app. The device will then change to the current thermostat mode.

Pro-tip: If you want Homey to have complete control, make sure to turn on "Control Device Individually" in the Mill app. If not, the Mill app might override Homey. 😱🔧

Now we also support Energy (requires re-pairing if device was added prior to version 1.0.6). Set power consumption in device settings to match the heater model.

We speak your language! 🌍💬 Supported languages:

Privacy ⛔🕵️‍♂️
We're using Sentry.io to log exceptions and errors. By installing this app, you accept that the app may send error logs to Sentry. No personal or device information, like email, passwords, Homey identification etc., is ever sent, only logs regarding the error if that occurred.

Disclaimer ⚖️
Use this app at your own risk. The app has been developed using the same APIs and interfaces used by the official Mill app, but there is a chance that API calls can have unexpected consequences for which nobody but you are responsible.
